Presentation Note:

Nabaztag Revival Project

A connected rabbit integrated with ChatGPT using a Raspberry Pi 4.

The Nabaztag is an IoT "smart object" created by the French company Violet, invented by Rafi Haladjian and Olivier Mével. Its server and vocal assistant were discontinued in 2011.

The Goal is Achievable  
Required Functional Analyses  
How we will Accomplish This Project (Roles and Framework)
We already have a programmable Nabaztag equipped with a Raspberry Pi 4, so the user interface is not an issue.

Functional Analysis
The Nabaztag includes a microphone for voice recognition. 

However, we need to determine the cost of accessing:  
Google’s API for speech synthesis
OpenAI’s ChatGPT API for text generation

Three Core Services:  

_Speech recognition.  

_Text-to-speech generation via ChatGPT.  

_Voice synthesis.

Coordination and Planning
We used Zoom to discuss:  
The Agile mindset and Scrum process.  
The collaborator’s typical workflow in their company.  

Concepts like Proof of Concept (POC), tickets, sprints, Slack, Gantt charts, daily demos, and “recipes.”

We allocated sufficient time to establish an effective planning meeting.
